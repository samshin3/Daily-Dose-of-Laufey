Daily-Dose-of-Laufey

Description:
This is a basic program that gives you a random song from the artist "Laufey" everytime you refresh the page. 
It utilizes the flask function in python to create a webpage that runs all the python codes.

Disclaimer:
You will need to input your own Client ID and Client Secret for the program to function

Changing the webpage for different artists:
1. Open the file "dailydoseoflaufey.py"
2. On line 12, replace "Laufey" with any artist of your choice
   a. Note that depending on how many tracks your artist has released, not all of them will be cycled through.
